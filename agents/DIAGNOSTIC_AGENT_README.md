# üî¨ Network Diagnostic Agent

## Overview

The **Diagnostic Agent** is a CrewAI-based network troubleshooting specialist that performs deep investigation of network issues detected by the Monitor Agent. It uses sophisticated diagnostic tools to identify root causes and provide actionable recommendations.

---

## üéØ What It Does

When the Monitor Agent detects a problem (e.g., high latency, packet loss, connectivity failure), it alerts the Diagnostic Agent with context:

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "warnings": [{
    "type": "latency",
    "message": "High latency: 526.94ms (threshold: 200ms)",
    "value": 526.94
  }],
  "metrics": {
    "ping": {"latency_ms": 526.94, "packet_loss": 0},
    "dns": {"latency_ms": 44.02},
    "signal": {"signal_dbm": -64, "quality": "fair"}
  }
}
```

The Diagnostic Agent then:

1. **Analyzes symptoms** - What's slow? What's working?
2. **Forms hypotheses** - WiFi? Router? ISP? DNS?
3. **Runs strategic tests** - Uses diagnostic tools to gather evidence
4. **Correlates findings** - LLM analyzes all data to identify root cause
5. **Provides diagnosis** - Structured report with recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è Diagnostic Tools (7 Total)

### 1. **`ping_multiple_targets`** - Isolate Problem Scope
Tests connectivity to multiple targets to determine where the issue is:
- **Router** (local network)
- **ISP Gateway** (upstream)
- **8.8.8.8** (Google DNS - internet)
- **1.1.1.1** (Cloudflare - internet)

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {"target": "192.168.50.1", "latency_ms": 19.82},  // Router: FAST ‚úÖ
    {"target": "8.8.8.8", "latency_ms": 208.52},      // Internet: SLOW ‚ö†Ô∏è
    {"target": "1.1.1.1", "latency_ms": 101.40}       // Internet: SLOW ‚ö†Ô∏è
  ]
}
```
**Conclusion:** Router is fine, but external connectivity is slow.

---

### 2. **`run_traceroute`** - Find Where Delays Occur
Traces the network path hop-by-hop to identify where latency accumulates:

**Example Output:**
```
1. 192.168.1.1      (router)      - 5ms   ‚úÖ
2. 10.0.0.1         (ISP gateway) - 15ms  ‚úÖ
3. 203.12.45.1      (ISP core)    - 250ms ‚ö†Ô∏è  <-- DELAY HERE!
4. 8.8.8.8          (Google DNS)  - 255ms
```
**Conclusion:** Delay at hop 3 (ISP network) - ISP routing issue.

---

### 3. **`scan_wifi_channels`** - Check WiFi Interference
Scans for all nearby WiFi networks and identifies channel congestion:

**Real Example from Raspberry Pi:**
```
Networks found: 63 networks!
Current channel: 35

Channel congestion:
  Channel 6:  9 networks  ‚ö†Ô∏è HEAVILY CONGESTED
  Channel 52: 9 networks  ‚ö†Ô∏è HEAVILY CONGESTED
  Channel 1:  6 networks
```
**Conclusion:** Heavy WiFi interference - switch channels or use 5GHz.

---

### 4. **`check_dns_servers`** - Test DNS Performance
Tests each configured DNS server's response time:

**Example Output:**
```
DNS 192.168.50.1: 52.74ms  ‚úÖ
DNS 8.8.8.8:      15.20ms  ‚úÖ
```
**Conclusion:** DNS is working fine - not the problem.

---

### 5. **`check_network_congestion`** - Monitor Bandwidth Usage
Checks if the network interface is saturated:

**Example Output:**
```
Upload:   0.03 Mbps
Download: 0.02 Mbps
Active connections: 13
Errors: 0
```
**Conclusion:** Very low usage - not a bandwidth congestion issue.

---

### 6. **`check_arp_table`** - Verify Local Network Activity
Lists devices on the local network to verify connectivity:

**Example Output:**
```
Devices: 6
  192.168.50.1    - d4:13:f8:59:ca:40 (router)
  192.168.50.149  - 12:9f:58:f4:0b:a0
  192.168.50.92   - 0a:01:95:22:8a:f6
```
**Conclusion:** Local network is active and responsive.

---

### 7. **`capture_network_packets`** *(Optional - requires pyshark/tshark)*
Deep packet inspection to detect:
- Packet retransmissions
- Out-of-order packets
- Protocol-level issues
- Packet loss patterns

---

## üß† How the LLM Analyzes Data

The Diagnostic Agent's LLM receives all test results and performs systematic analysis:

### **Step 1: Pattern Recognition**
```
Observation:
- Ping to router: 19ms    (FAST ‚úÖ)
- Ping to internet: 208ms (SLOW ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- DNS resolution: 52ms    (NORMAL ‚úÖ)
- WiFi signal: -64dBm     (FAIR ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Packet loss: 0%         (GOOD ‚úÖ)
```

### **Step 2: Form Hypotheses**
```
Hypothesis 1: WiFi interference or weak signal
  Evidence: Signal is -64dBm (borderline), 63 networks detected
  Likelihood: HIGH

Hypothesis 2: Router overload
  Evidence: Could be multiple devices
  Likelihood: MEDIUM

Hypothesis 3: ISP throttling
  Evidence: External hosts are slow
  Likelihood: LOW (DNS is fast)
```

### **Step 3: Structured Diagnosis**
```json
{
  "primary_issue": "high_latency",
  "root_cause": "wifi_signal_degradation_or_interference",
  "confidence": "high",
  "evidence": [
    "Router latency is normal (19ms)",
    "External latency is high (208ms)",
    "WiFi signal is -64dBm (fair quality)",
    "63 WiFi networks detected (heavy congestion)",
    "No packet loss (stable connection)"
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "cause": "WiFi interference or weak signal",
      "likelihood": "high",
      "reasoning": "Signal borderline + heavy channel congestion"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "action": "move_closer_to_router",
      "impact": "Reduce latency by 50-70%",
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    {
      "action": "switch_to_5ghz_band",
      "impact": "Less interference, faster speeds",
      "confidence": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

### **Mode 1: Test Mode** (Simulate Alert)
Simulates a high latency alert and runs full diagnostic:

```bash
python3 diagnostic_agent.py --mode test --model ollama/gemma3:1b
```

### **Mode 2: File Mode** (Load Alert from JSON)
Load a real alert from Monitor Agent:

```bash
# Monitor Agent saves alert to file
python3 monitor_agent.py --mode check > alert.json

# Diagnostic Agent investigates
python3 diagnostic_agent.py --mode file --alert-file alert.json
```

### **Mode 3: Integrated Mode** (Called by Monitor Agent)
In production, Monitor Agent automatically triggers Diagnostic Agent when issues detected.

### **Mode 4: Tool Demo** (No LLM Required)
Test diagnostic tools directly without LLM overhead:

```bash
python3 test_diagnostic_tools.py
```

This demonstrates the investigation process and shows what data the LLM would analyze.

## üìä Real-World Example

### **Scenario:** User reports "Internet is slow"

**Monitor Agent detects:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Network DEGRADED
- High latency: 526ms (threshold: 200ms)
- Signal: -64dBm (fair)
- DNS: 44ms (normal)
```

**Diagnostic Agent investigates:**

1. **Ping Multiple Targets:**
   - Router: 19ms ‚úÖ
   - Google: 208ms ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Cloudflare: 101ms ‚ö†Ô∏è
   
   **Finding:** Local network is fine, external is slow.

2. **Traceroute:**
   - Hop 1 (router): 5ms
   - Hop 2 (ISP): 250ms ‚ö†Ô∏è **DELAY HERE!**
   
   **Finding:** Delay at ISP gateway.

3. **WiFi Scan:**
   - 63 networks detected
   - Channel 6: 9 networks (congested)
   - Current channel: 35
   
   **Finding:** Heavy WiFi congestion.

4. **DNS Test:**
   - DNS responds in 52ms ‚úÖ
   
   **Finding:** DNS is not the problem.

**LLM Diagnosis:**
```
Primary Issue: High network latency (526ms)

Root Cause: WiFi signal quality + ISP routing issue
Confidence: HIGH

Evidence:
  ‚Ä¢ Router is responsive (19ms)
  ‚Ä¢ ISP gateway shows high latency (250ms at hop 2)
  ‚Ä¢ WiFi signal is borderline (-64dBm)
  ‚Ä¢ Heavy WiFi channel congestion (63 networks)
  ‚Ä¢ DNS working normally (not DNS issue)

Recommendations:
  1. Move closer to router or improve WiFi signal
  2. Contact ISP about routing latency
  3. Switch to less congested WiFi channel
  4. Consider wired connection for stability
```

**Solution Agent** would then propose:
- "Move to 5GHz WiFi band"
- "Switch to channel 157 (less congested)"
- "Contact ISP about gateway latency"
